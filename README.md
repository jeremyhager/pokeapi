# code-samples
Code samples for different projects

Currently a work in progress, but at the most basic level it can be run as follows:
```shell
go build .
code-samples pokeapi pokemon 1
```

Or by running `main.go` directly:
```shell
go run main.go pokeapi pokemon 1
```

Example output
```shell
‚ùØ ./code-samples pokeapi pokemon 1
pokemon info:
{Name:bulbasaur Url:https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/1/}
```
